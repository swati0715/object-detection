# object-detection
This project focuses on implementing an Object Detection model using deep learning techniques to identify and locate objects within images. The system is designed to detect multiple objects in a single frame and draw bounding boxes around them along with class labels.

🧾 Project Overview Implements a complete pipeline for object detection Uses pre-trained models for transfer learning Supports both image and real-time detection Includes performance metrics and visualization

Features:- Dataset loading and annotation parsing Model architecture setup (e.g., SSD, YOLO, or Faster R-CNN) Training with augmentation Evaluation on test data Visualization of predicted bounding boxes

Technologies Used:- Python TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch OpenCV NumPy Matplotlib COCO or custom annotation format

Project Structure:- #bash ├── Object_Detection.ipynb # Main Jupyter Notebook ├── /images # Folder for example inputs/outputs ├── /models # Trained models or configs ├── /data # Dataset and annotations └── README.md # Project documentation

Example Results Input Image Detected Objects 🛻 Car, 🧍 Person Sample output from the object detection model showing bounding boxes and labels.

Dataset: This project uses a custom dataset or a public dataset like COCO, Pascal VOC, or Open Images. Annotations are typically in .xml or .json format and processed for training and validation. If you're using a specific dataset, update this section with its name and source.
